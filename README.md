# Dynamic Autoencoder: from reconstruction towards centroids construction (DynAE).

This repository contains a Tensorflow implementation of our paper Deep Clustering with a Dynamic Autoencoder: from reconstruction towards centroids construction.

# Usage
The easiest way to run this code without installing any package:
1) Clone the code from this repository.
2) Open your Google Drive.
3) Make a folder entitled Colab inside your Drive.
4) Put the cloned code inside this folder. 
5) Check that the code path inside your Drive is "/My Drive/Colab/DynAE" to avoid making changes to your notebook.
6) Run the nootebook "dynAE.ipynb" using Google Colaboratory.


We have already prepared pretrained weights for MNIST.
